GEE(Generalized Estimating Equation) and GEEFirth
======================================================

When the data are not driven from identical independent distribution (i.i.d), we cannot apply the tranditional statistical methods used in i.i.d assumptions.
In this project, we consider repeated data which have some dependency or correlation between observations. We use GEE(Generalized Estimating Equation) to obtain more valid estiamtion of standard error (or confidence interval) of the regression coefficients. and we also consider the separation of repeated data which can occur when the number of data is small. We compare the performances of GEE and GEEFirth in the sense of esimating the standard error (or confidence interval) of the regression coefficients when the separation occur in the repeated data.
